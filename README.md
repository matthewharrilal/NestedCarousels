# 📱 Pinterest-Inspired Expanding Collection View

---

## Project Overview
This iOS project demonstrates a **sophisticated** and **visually appealing** nested collection view with interactive animations. The collection view cells smoothly transition from a compact state to a full-screen view, adopting a Pinterest-style layout. The focus of this project is on delivering a **refined user interface**, with content kept to a bare minimum.

## ✨ Key Features

- **📚 Nested Collection View**: The project utilizes a collection view nested within another collection view, providing a rich and complex UI experience.

- **🎨 Animated Expanding Cells**: Tapping on a collection view cell triggers a smooth, fluid animation that expands the cell into a full-screen view, creating an immersive user experience.

- **📌 Pinterest-Style Layout**: Upon expanding, the collection view adopts a Pinterest-style layout, optimizing the visual arrangement of items in a grid.

- **🎛️ Contextual Menu with Presentation Controller**: A custom presentation controller is used to display a contextual menu when interacting with the expanded collection view, enhancing user engagement.

- **🔧 Minimalist Design**: The project is intentionally kept barebones with a focus on the user interface rather than content, making it a perfect starting point for UI exploration and customization.

This video showcases the **fluidity** and **responsiveness** of the UI animations, emphasizing the seamless transition between states within the collection view.

## 🚀 How to Use
This project is designed for developers interested in creating **dynamic** and **interactive** UI components in iOS. It serves as a template for implementing advanced collection view features with custom animations and layout management.

Feel free to explore the code, modify the UI elements, and integrate your own content to build upon this barebones structure.
